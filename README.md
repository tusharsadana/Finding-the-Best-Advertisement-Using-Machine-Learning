# Finding-the-Best-Advertisement-Using-Machine-Learning

This Project was created to maximise the conversion rate of a company. A company with 10 different ads, provided a dataset
in which it was shown which ad were clicked by any particular user out of those 10 ads.

Now, the aim was to find the best add among these.
